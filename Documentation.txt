So here I will document how I learn PYTHON using the documntation in a very fun way 
What is covered in this are the following:
        Python interpreter
        Python data types
        Control Flow tools
        Data Structures
        Modules
        Input / Output
        Errors and Exceptions
        Classes
        Standard Library
        Virtual Environments and Packages






   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS AND PACKAGES  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We find sometimes python applications use packages and modules that dont come as part of the standard Library
One Python installation may not be able to meet allt his requirements!
Versions may conflict and and so virtual Environments come to our rescue.
Virtual Environments are self contained directory trees' that contain a python installation for a particular version of python plus a number of packages
think of it as a small complete computer inside your computer where you can install various packages and use them without affecting the global installed version
